# Novelty Detection for Federated Learning
**Lightweight Anomaly Detection at Scale**

Detects novel/anomalous text inputs in **federated learning (FL)** with minimal resource usage. Optimized for **1M–100M devices**, reducing communication overhead by **~80%** while preserving model accuracy.

---

## Core 
- **Why?** Flags critical updates in FL, cutting noise and communication.
- **How?** Uses **KL Divergence + Fisher Information** to score "novelty" per input.
- **For Who?** Researchers/developers scaling FL to **massive device networks**.
